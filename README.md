# mocha-txAdminLogs
 Simply Logs txAdmin events to discord
 This was made using 'txsv:logger:menuEvent' event located in the txAdmin source code located here -> https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin/tree/master 
 I take no credit for this, just put it into a resource and made it use discord logs, as i saw this was requested on the cfx.re forums a couple days ago.
